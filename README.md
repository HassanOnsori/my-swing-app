### my-swing-app
 - It is an example of a simple Java application using the Swing library, JUnit for unit testing, and Maven as a build automation tool.
 - I used GitHub Actions to automatically build and run my unit tests for the Java application.
 - I added code quality analysis to the GitHub Actions workflow by using a tool like SonarQube.
 SonarQube result will be generated on https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=HassanOnsori_my-swing-app.
